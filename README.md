# Restaurant Recommender
This is a script to recommend a place to eat based off a user input name or food type. 

This is part of the Codecademy Data Structures class, for now I'm using a premade data set of resturants, but in the future I will change that out with some real world ones that are local. The script itself will be pretty generic, so it could probably be changed to recommend books or movies with minimal adjustments.

Once I have completed this project I plan on wirting up a blog post.
